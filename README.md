# Learning Theory and Statistical Optimization

This is a GitHub page for the reading group on Learning Theory and Statistical Optimization held at the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford.

## Organization

We will hold hybrid sessions (as we do with classes), so that people can attend/present remotely. **Priority for the physical presence is reserved to the people presenting in the reading group**. Anyone who is interested to attend in person should let us know beforehand (please email vaskevicius.tomas [at] gmail.com to confirm as we need to make sure we do not exceed the max room capacity).

**Where**: Social Area (Ground Floor), Department of Statistics (max room capacity: 14 people).

**When**: Tuesdays, from 15:30 to 17:00, starting from Week 2 until Week 8.

## Instructions for the Speakers

Instead of whiteboard, we will be using graphical tablets. The speakers can either use their own equipments, or use the equipment available on the computer in the Social Area (Windows credentials are needed to log in). It is also fine to use slides, but ideally we should be using the whiteboard on Teams (or other methods). **The speakers should make sure to try the equipment beforehand.**

Speakers are asked to upload latex notes (up to 10 pages). Please store your latex files in ./tex/{term}/week{#}. Please also upload a compiled pdf of your notes.

To clone the repository execute
```
git clone https://github.com/TomasVaskevicius/learning-and-statistical-optimization.git
```

From the root of the cloned github repository, go to the directory which corresponds to your presentation. For example,
```
cd tex/michaelmas/week2
```

Upload you tex files, compile a pdf, and push to this repository. For example,
```
git add *.tex *.pdf {or whatever other files your are uploading}
git commit -m "Notes for the presentation of..."
git push
```
